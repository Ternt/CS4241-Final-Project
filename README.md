# Final Project

Our final project is a course planner similar to [WPI Planner](https://planner.wpi.edu/), using WPI's public course data to help students schedule classes, plan their degree track, and track prerequisites. We have 3 main features:
- Scheduling is similar to that of WPI planner, allowing users to view section times for individual courses they select. Due to time constraints, our version was implemented more naively and does not have the full list of features that the WPI planner's scheduler have.
- The tracking page is a digital, automated version of the PDF given to students to see what classes they need to graduate. They can select courses from the various subject categories, and see if those courses fit into the requirements.
- The course flow chart shows how the courses selected in the tracking sheet fit together in terms of prerequisites, and allow the user to view all prerequisites for the course that have not been added to the tracking sheet.

## Our tech stack

Here is a list of the technologies we used:

### Frontend stack
- React
- Mostly CSS Modules
- Some TailwindCSS sprinkled in
- Mantine UI Library
- Vite

### Backend stack
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB (database)

### Deployment & Project structure
- Pnpm 
- Turborepo
- Vercel
- Render

For deployment, we hosted an api server on Render and the actual application on Vercel.  

## Challenges we faced

The big technical challenge that we faced was during deployment. Setting up Express for Vercel was not a intuitive. Additionally, having a monorepo structure didn't help. Instead, we opted to deploy the server on Render, which supported Web Services rather enforcing a serverless framework onto the developer. Once the API server was deployed on Render, setting up the frontend to deploy on Vercel was a simple task.

An additional challenge was trying to align schedules with each other. Because of problem, development was very uncoordinated and code quality couldn't be ensured. By the point code was commited, it would be too much work to parse. Eventhough facing this problem, we try our best to meetup with each other, stay on top of things, and assign tasks. Although with these hiccups, we were able to complete the application in time and implemented some features that if given enough time to polish, we think, would be really benefit the WPI community.

## What everyone did

### Cameron
- worked on the flowchart page, which includes
- linking it to the tracking sheet selected courses.
- colored nodes for selected/unselected classes, colored edges between nodes indicating prereq type,
- a full prereq option that recursively gets all of the prereq requirements for each course and displays them as unselected courses
- clickable nodes that animate edges connected to the node, draggable nodes, and included interface for panning, zooming, and fitting to screen.
- also worked on the login page and functionality, which uses localstorage to make sure users can't navigate to pages they aren't supposed to and logout functionality.

### Thinh
- Setup the development techstack and REPL for the project using pnpm and turborepo
- Setup the api server including database connection, database schemas, lots of data parsing for the backend
- Made api endpoints used by the client to communicate with the client
- Setup data fetching functions so that the client can send api calls and fetch data from the backend
- Worked on implementing the common features of WPI planner, e.i, Course list and Schedule, making sure to include all the relevant edge cases.
- Rewrote and improved on the initial iteration's system, making client and server communication much simpler, thus simplifying the codebase. (2nd iteration is in `dev` and is not deployed)
- Optimized the 2nd iteration to make rendering feel snappy to improve UX 
- Deployed the web app and making sure everything worked, CORs, rewriting Vercel routes.
- Used Render for the api server and Vercel for the frontend, which routes api calls to the api server.

### Silas
- Setup the Express server
- Created the Tracking page, which consisted of:
- Creating Types for majors, course categories, and course requirements
- Creating the requirements for the CS major
- Parsing the course data to display courses based on category
- Creating validation system for course requirements based on selected courses
 
### Noah
- Worked on navbar (AppLayout)
- Worked on page routes (Login)
- Worked on api endpoint routers
- Investigated deployments with Vercel and Render
- Worked on localStrategy authorization (incomplete)
- Conceptualized UI/UX via storyboards
- Organized Jira tasks

## Notes

This version of the app is rather messy. This was mainly due to a poorly thought-out system architecture that made
both client and server state management really verbose and bloated. If you feel down in the dumps while looking at
this codebase and are curious, the improved version that didn't make it to production is in the `dev` branch and 
contains a much MUCH simpler codebase.
